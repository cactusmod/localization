# Contributing Guidelines

## Rules for Translation

1. **File Limitation:** Only modify or add JSON files related to translations. Pull requests with changes to other files will not be merged.

2. **Debugging/Testing:** Remove any debugging or testing translations that are not actually used in the mod.

3. **Translation Quality:** Avoid using automatic translation tools like Google Translate for entire language files. It's acceptable for single terms, but the majority should be manually translated for accuracy.

4. **Submission Permissions:** Only the creator or someone with permission from the author should submit the translation file.
